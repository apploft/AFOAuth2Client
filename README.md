AFOAuth2Client
=========
A copy of Mattt Thompson's AFOAuth2Client, that was deprecated in favor of AFOAuth2Manager. For everyone who cannot update to AFNetworking 2.x because of dependency resolution conflicts.

For documentation see [AFOAuth2Manager](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFOAuth2Manager).
